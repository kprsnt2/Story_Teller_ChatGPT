# Story_Teller_ChatGPT
Story teller app using ChatGPT & streamlit

In this I have used OpenAI API to create a story telling for my kid who is 5 years old.

replace with your API key and add this to streamlit or run "streamlit run app.py"

This will show page where kid need to enter keyword like train or bus or barbie, then click on generate story

it will provide you the audio file with story which can be played with play button.
